# PortofolioUsingFramer
Being learning how to use Framer lately. For me to perfect I need to learn Typescript and JavaScript.THis is a miniproject , want it to be my closure for this year. It still needs alot of correction..This is my first try suing the tool(Framer) and I hope with more practice I the project will look even better
