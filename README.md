# PortofolioUsingFramer
Iâ€™ve recently started learning how to use Framer, and this project is my first attempt at building something with the tool. To truly master Framer, I realize I need to deepen my understanding of TypeScript and JavaScript.

This is a mini-project that I hope will serve as a meaningful closure to this year. While it still needs a lot of corrections and refinement, Iâ€™m excited about the progress Iâ€™ve made so far. With more practice and dedication, I believe this project will improve significantly and reflect my growth in using Framer.
